# Hidden Markov Model based segmentation for Phonocardiograms

Python implementation of https://github.com/davidspringer/Springer-Segmentation-Code 

## Using This Code

An example of how to use this code can be found in `full_training_script.py`. The script takes two arguments, the directory for the training data and the directory for the test data. The data in both directories is expected to be `.wav` files and corresponding `.tsv` files in the format specified in the [2022 Physionet Challenge](https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2022/#Oliveira2022)
